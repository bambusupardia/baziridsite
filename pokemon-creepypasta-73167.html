A black shape seemingly void of feeling, it is hidden from my senses. Surely this thing must be living, but all I can perceive is a lack of life where something should be.</p><p>My trainer issues a command. Surely, he will know how to deal with this creature, maybe he can see what I cannot. I raise the full force of my psychic powers against it.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>My attack simply vanishes, as though sucked into the emptiness that lies before me. My trainer is as stunned as I am, I can feel his concern. For his sake, there must be some way to- Wait, what’s this?!</p><p>The blackness expands, obscuring the surroundings from my sight. I motion to flee, but it’s already too late.</p><p>Now I can feel something from this darkness. Fear. Fear and despair. So cold. With a jolt, I realise I have ceased to levitate. These slender limbs long since ceased to support my body. As I collapse to the floor, I realise I can no longer sense anything, no longer see anything.</p><p>Oh master, I am blind. Help me.</p><p>Help me…</p><p>To my shame, I panic, try to lash out with my powers. Nothing happens. What is this? What has it done to me?</p><p>-</p><p>My trainer, my trainer is here. He speaks, tells me the creature has fled. Slowly, whatever it has done begins to subside, Bit by bit, I’m able to see again.</p><p>But what I see… My trainer, he’s looking at me in a different way now.</p><p>I used to think I could deal with anything. So did he.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXZi%2FprHPsqeaq6SWe3h%2FkG9uaKiRnLJugJE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
