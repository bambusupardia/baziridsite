On Sept. 16, 1920, suspected anarchists <a href=#>set off a bomb on Wall Street</a> on one the busiest corners of Manhattan’s Financial District. A horse-drawn wagon was concealing 100 pounds of dynamite, which detonated at 12:01 p.m. The blast, which killed 38 people, was considered the most deadly politically motivated terrorist activity on American soil at the time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177867 alt="Wallstreet Bomb" width=600 height=479 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wallstreet-bomb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177867 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Aftermath of the Wall Street bombing. 1920.</span></p><p>Nine years later the stock market crashed, signalling the beginning of the Great Depression.</p><p>But in the intermittent period between the two tragedies, 1920s New York truly roared.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177879 alt="Times Square Twenties" width=900 height=703 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/times-square-twenties.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177879 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Edwin Levick/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Times Square illuminated during the 1920s.</span></p><p>The early 1920s in New York saw the openings of some famed establishments. The Apollo Theatre on 42nd St., the Roseland Ballroom in the Theater District, and the Cotton Club in Harlem.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4702 alt=new-york-1920s-jazz width=750 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-york-1920s-jazz.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-4702 class=wp-caption-text>The Cotton Club on 142nd Street.</p><p>During what’s called the “Great Migration,” African Americans moved from the South to northern cities. By the 1920s, around 200,000 African Americans made New York City their home. But because segregation laws were still in place and housing tensions existed, they created their own community in Harlem.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Lindy Photograph" width=750 height=518 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-york-1920s-lindy-hop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As a result, Harlem became a cultural hub for dynamic jazz and blues as well as a platform for rising jazz artists like Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Coleman Hawkins and “King” Oliver. The musical genre became one of the most basic and potent expressions of New York’s cultural life promoted through recordings, broadcasts, and live performances. It also gave birth to the popular Lindy Hop dance.</p><p>In other parts of the city the changing times were expressed through fashion. Both ostentatious designer accessories and flapper-style outfits represented the lavishness and scandalous air of the 1920s.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177880 alt="Vogue New York" width=800 height=656 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/vogue-new-york.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177880 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Conde Nast Collection Editorial/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Model Hannah Lee Sherman dressed in a Chanel coat, brimless hat, fox stole, suede bag, and snakeskin shoes is helped out of a car on Park Avenue.</span></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Fashion in New York in the 1920s" width=750 height=884 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-york-1920s-fashion2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The 1920s was also the era of Prohibition. The 18th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution banned the sale, manufacturing, and transportation of alcohol. This invited the interest of bootleggers, also known as rum-runners, who would smuggle liquor from overseas and bring them to the secret speakeasies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177882 alt="Seixed Liquor New York" width=900 height=631 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/seixed-liquor-new-york.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177882 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Customs men examining liquor seized from a rum-runner ship from Havana that docked at a port on the harbor of New York.</span></p><p>Mobsters vied for bootlegger business, ushering in a sophisticated but sordid age or organized crime. Money laundering and the bribing of police and other public officials in New York in the 1920s became very common.</p><p>During this time, the Mafia flourished in New York City, which unsurprisingly came to be known as the world capital of crime. Crime bosses like Salvatore Maranzano and Lucky Luciano became household names in New York in the 1920s and the decades that followed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146115 alt="Lucky Luciano drinking wine." width=900 height=556 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lucky-luciano-drinking.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146115 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Lucky Luciano drinking a glass of wine.</span></p><p>Many firsts were experienced during 1920s New York.

Skyscrapers began to transform the skyline with the begining of construction on both the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177888 alt="Construction Empire State Building" width=900 height=720 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/construction-empire-state-building.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177888 class=wp-caption-text>A worker bolts beams during Empire State Building construction; the Chrysler Building is seen in the background.<br></p><p>The decadence that defined 1920s New York came to a grinding halt after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The city once drenched glamor quickly caved into one of crippling emptiness.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="New York City 1920s Empire State Building" width=750 height=957 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-york-1920s-empire-state-building-construction.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But the opulence of the era continued to leave a vivid impression decades later. Even today, you can find recreations of 1920s New York in the form of flapper-themed parties and speakeasy-style bars. Of course, nothing will ever embody the true nature of the Roaring Twenties.</p><p>If you enjoy these amazing photographs of 1920s New York, be sure to check out <a href=#>the most iconic photographs of the 1950s</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvsdZmsKiqm2J%2Ben6PrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
