Yes, I am.”</p><p>Sam Elliot began his public apology to the crew of The Power of the Dog while promoting his Paramount+ drama series, 1883, by warning the audience:</p><p>“First and foremost, do not create a podcast with the initials WTF. I wasn’t very eloquent about it; I wasn’t very articulate about it. And I said certain things that were hurtful to individuals, and I’m sorry.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Sam Elliott apologizes for his controversial comments he previously made about ‘The Power of the Dog’ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#DeadlineContenders</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XZ86wCAXmL</a></p><p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 10, 2022</a></p><p>He then acknowledged his career’s success to the LGBTQIA+ community:</p><p>“My whole career, the homosexual community has been amazing to me. And I mean my whole career, dating back to before I moved to this place. Until now, I’ve had friends at every level and in every job description. I’m sorry if I offended any of those friends or someone I cared about. And everyone else who was influenced by the language I used.”</p><h2>What did Sam Elliot say about Jane Campion’s new film?</h2><p>Sam Elliott addressed the Oscar-winning picture (which 67-year-old Campion wrote and directed) on Marc Maron’s show in March 2021.&nbsp;Elliott, who has appeared in several Western films and television programs, compared the appearance of the “cowboys” in the film to Chippendales dancers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Sam-Elliot-1.jpg alt="Sam Elliot" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“They’re all dressed in chaps and no shirts. Throughout the f**king film, there are several references to homos**uality.”</p><p>The host responded as follows:</p><p>“I believe that’s what the movie is about.”</p><p>Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a grizzled cattle rancher who is attracted to the son of a widow, played by Kirsten Dunst, who has just arrived to his ranch in The Power of the Dog. In an age and society that emphasizes fixed gender norms and expectations, Cumberbatch’s character fights with his sexuality.</p><p>The Oscar nominee also attacked Campion’s choice of setting for the film:</p><p>“And why in the f**k does she shoot this film in New Zealand, label it Montana, and say, ‘This is how it was?'”</p><p>According to Elliott, the shooting location “rubbed [him] the wrong way,” as did the “myth” of “these macho dudes out there with the cattle.”</p><p>“I recently got back from f**king Texas, where I spent time with families — not guys, but families. Families that are large, lengthy, and extensive, with several generations.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Sam-Elliot-2.jpg alt="Sam Elliot" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While speaking to Deadline, Jane Campion replied to Elliott’s inflammatory statements, saying it is extremely unfortunate that he touched the “trifecta” of homophobia, sexism, and xenophobia. She called him a b*tch and added that he is an actress, not a cowboy.</p><p>In Sam Elliot’s series, he portrays Shea Brennan, a fierce Civil War warrior who leads the Dutton Family and a gang of European immigrants over the border in 1883.</p><p>Sam Elliot will also be nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Actor category, while 1883 will compete in the Limited Series category due to the drama’s cancellation for a second season.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Sam Elliot</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqVdmrmttc6tZKGZo2KusbvLqJ6ispWZeqe70WafoqtdmLyvwNGorZ6qo56urXnCqKSmnZ6pwG6twaisrWWknbJuvM6wnKtln5t6tbTEZpuon18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
