Today’s Komodo Dragons can weigh up to 150 pounds, but their ancestor, Megalania prisca — also called Varanus priscus or Giant Monitor Lizard — could grow to between 500 and 4,000 pounds. It’s the largest known lizard to have ever walked the Earth. Between two million and 40,000 years ago, these intimidating creatures easily reigned over present-day eastern Australia."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Up to 25 feet long, they likely feasted on a wide variety of animals, including kangaroos, pygmy elephants, and tortoises.</p><p>Though they could certainly use their size to subdue and kill prey, the M. prisca also had another tool at their disposal: toxic saliva. Scientists believe that they used venom from glands in their lower jaw to kill.</p><p>That said, it’s possible that M. prisca occasionally faced predators of its own. During its life, it shared an environment with The Marsupial Lion (called Thylacoleo) and a 500-pound crocodile (known as the Quinkana). It’s hard to predict if the Giant Monitor Lizard could win a bout with these dangerous prehistoric animals.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-348421 alt="Varanus Priscus Skull" width=900 height=436 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/varanus-priscus-skull.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-348421 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A skull of the Giant Monitor Lizard.</span></p><p>English naturalist Richard Owen first described M. prisca in 1859. He’s the one who gave it its name (which means giant roamer) but contemporary scientists believe he mislabeled it, which is why it also goes by the name Varanus priscus.</p><p>Since Owen’s discovery, however, scientists have found very few fossilized remains of the Giant Monitor Lizard. That means that there’s still a lot to learn about this prehistoric animal.</p><p>There are some theories out there about why the M. prisca died out, however. Although humans didn’t seem to hunt it directly, they did hunt animals that the M. prisca relied on as prey. As such, people may have played an indirect role in its extinction.</p><p>Then again, as with the giant sloth, some believe that the Great Monitor Lizard never went extinct at all. Rumor has it that the beast simply crept into the Australian wilderness and lives there to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxvsShoKysn6e2pHnAp6CmmZyofHc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
