He was also charismatic and funny. He brought a guitar and amplifier to our house and left it there. He showed me how to play Jumpin’ Jack Flash, Johnny B. Goode and Chuck Berry rhythms.</p><p><strong>I was raped</strong> when I was 14. I just wanted to matter to this older boy. I grieved for three days when I wrote about the rape in my book.</p><p><strong>I was a teenager</strong> in the ’70s and dating wasn’t how you did things. You had sex and left as boyfriend<br>and girlfriend or you didn’t.</p><p><strong>When I was drinking</strong> and using drugs, I ended up with guys who didn’t push it as hard as I did. My boyfriends were either always annoyed with me or reining me in. It helped keep me alive.</p><p><strong>The late John Belushi</strong> and I connected as a music fans. He got the Guitar Centre in Hollywood to open in the middle of the night so we could all jam. He loved the blues, like me.</p><p><strong>When I got sober</strong>, aged 30, I went on a few dates and found it appalling. I had never started a relationship sober; drinking was how I fell into things.</p><p><strong>Blondie drummer</strong> Clem Burke and I dated in the ’80s. He was an amazing boyfriend and is more like my brother now. We were both from cool bands and I enjoyed every minute with him.</p><p><span class="_2wzgv D5idv _3lVFK"><span class=_29Qt8></span><span class=_3qqDc>Loading</span></span></p><p><strong>Clem and I</strong> are only children and both of us had only one parent we were responsible for. We both had success at the same age – he was 20 when Blondie got huge and I was 22 when the Go-Go’s did. He didn’t want his band to break up when they did and I was the same. He totally got what drove me to play and what it was like to be in a popular band.</p><p><strong>My boyfriend</strong>, composer Mikel Rouse, and I have a long-distance relationship. Sometimes we go to LA and stay with my ex-husband [Steve Weisburd, 2002-12], who I have a daughter with. We are an integrated, modern family.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybrPOZp6oq12grrW02GatmqSVo8GqusRmpqmdnqh6tryMmpmoraRitaa%2BjKumnKOep7ytuIyloJ%2Bdo6nGrbGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
