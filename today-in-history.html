Considered to be the cradle of Orthodox Christianity, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe for centuries.

The Pullman Palace Car Company began cutting workers’ wages after the economic depression of 1893, causing workers to strike. The company’s president, George M. Pullman, refused to meet with the angry workers, and as a result, the workers walked off their job sites.</p><p>After attracting the attention and support of the American Rail Union (ARU), the striking workers, now numbering in the hundred thousands, halted 29 major railroads. The federal government deployed troops to help end the strike, resulting in widespread violence and millions of dollars in damage. The strike eventually died down after railroad companies began hiring non-union workers, and the federal government created “Labor Day” as a national holiday to remember the incident and others like it.</p><h2>1969: The Battle Of Hamburger Hill Begins</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-421166 alt="Battle Of Hamburger Hill" width=800 height=627 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/battle-hamburger-hill-airborne-soldiers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-421166 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>United States Army Military History Institute</span><span class=caption-body>Wounded 101st Airborne soldiers are loaded into medevac helicopters after Operation Apache Snow.</span></p><p>The controversial Battle of Hamburger Hill begins in Vietnam. A part of Operation Apache Snow, the battle was an attempt by American forces to take the hill and therefore cut off North Vietnamese forces and protect nearby towns.</p><p>After suffering a high number of casualties, U.S. forces were forced to fall back. The battle raged for 10 days, and journalists covering the conflict nicknamed it the Battle of Hamburger Hill after this statement was made by 19-year-old Sergeant James Spears: “Have you ever been inside a hamburger machine? We just got cut to pieces by extremely accurate machine gun fire.” The hill was eventually captured by U.S. forces and subsequently abandoned, but the brutality of the clash sparked fierce criticism from anti-war activists and American politicians.</p><h2>1981: Bob Marley Dies</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-424535 alt="Bob Marley" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bob-marley-onstage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-424535 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Bob Marley raises his first while singing onstage in 1977.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Marley dies</a> of cancer in Miami.
