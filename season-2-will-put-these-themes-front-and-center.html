Now, new themes will be pushed front and center in season 2. <a rel=noopener href=#>BET</a> is reporting that the new season will unpack, “physical and emotional abuse, trust and abandonment issues, and the debilitating matter of police brutality against Black people in America.”</p><p>Moreover, there will be a very special episode highlighted this season. The episode will pay tribute to George Floyd,&nbsp;Breonna Taylor,&nbsp;Ahmaud Arbery, and a host of unidentified victims in Michigan, Texas, and California.</p><p>P-Valley is more than just a series about beautiful women. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/9GB2TNk6_HI?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><h2 id=h-there-will-be-a-major-time-jump-in-p-valley-season-2>There will be a major time jump in ‘P-Valley’ Season 2</h2><p>In addition to a new cast and crew, there will also be a major time jump between the first and second seasons. “<a href=#>Season 2</a>&nbsp;takes place five months after the season 1 finale,” Hall said in a behind-the-scenes video from&nbsp;<a href=#>Starz</a>. The pandemic has turned things upside down.
