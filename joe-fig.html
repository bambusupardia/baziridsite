It is a space for ideas to take physical form; it is a place for innovation and–pending the occupant’s mental state–alchemy. It is also deeply personal, simultaneously reflecting and shaping the artist’s creative process. Knowing this, American sculptor Joe Fig utilized his own talent to create miniature dioramas of famous artists’ studios and workspaces, recreating in great detail whole rooms in which they allowed their genius to germinate.</p><p>The result isn’t unlike a scene from “Inception”, but this really hits home when you imagine Fig sculpting the diorama of himself while in his studio–while physically standing in the very studio he’s recreating in miniature (see below).

Not only does Fig capture the physical likeness of each artist and their space, but he must also recreate tiny paintings and other classic works shown within the spaces, a true testament to his patience and attention to detail.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43728 alt="mini art studio ross bleckner" width=750 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mini-art-studio-Ross-Bleckner.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43728 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Joe Fig</a></p><p>Ross Bleckner’s studio space has the distinction of being located in a home once owned by Truman Capote. Bleckner purchased the home in 1993, and has been adding square footage (and a separate studio) to it ever since. A master of symbolic imagery, Bleckner says, “The experience of making a painting is very important to me—its physicality and its visceral connection to an engaged truth, which is determined by the reference to how an idea accords.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43724 alt="Chuck Close's Art Studio" width=750 height=499 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mini-art-studio-Chuck-Close.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43724 class=wp-caption-text><a href=#>Joe Fig</a></p><p>Chuck Close is well-known for his massive scale portraiture.

These sketches would become paintings of often intense realism, where he feels that he can make a connection with how those immediately involved in war are affected by it.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="mini art studio malcolm morley" width=750 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mini-art-studio-Malcolm-Morley.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Malcolm Morley discovered art during a short stint in prison, and has since achieved great success as a painter in the super-realist style, as well as abstract expressionism and post-pop. For the realism, he grids off a canvas and focuses on small areas at a time; a common practice to ward off the feeling of being overwhelmed by the vast detail needed in this genre. One could reason that this is why his studio is more organized than most.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="mini art studio matthew ritchie" width=750 height=502 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mini-art-studio-Matthew-Ritchie.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Quite a bit of London-born artist Matthew Ritchie’s work starts out with drawings, even though he is recognized as a painter. Regarding his process, Ritchie states that he “[starts] with a collection of ideas…and [draws] out all these different motifs, and then [lays] them on top of each other. So I have piles of semi-transparent drawings all layered on top of each other in my studio and they form a kind of tunnel of information.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt="mini art studio tom friedman" width=750 height=503 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mini-art-studio-Tom-Friedman.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>First gaining popularity as a found-object sculptor, contemporary artist Tom Friedman makes us question our ideas of perception and logic, often in a humorous or inventive way. Using many different objects means a fairly cluttered workspace. He currently works from his studio in Newton, Massachusetts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyru8RmnaKf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
