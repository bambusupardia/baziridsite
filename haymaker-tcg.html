The Haymaker deck archetype was a strong competitor in the early days of the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It was played heavily due to its fast, hard hitting nature that included control elements. Strategy  As one of the earliest deck archetypes, Haymaker took advantage of useful Trainer cards and Basic Pokémon from Base Set and Jungle to set up quickly and strike hard quickly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

All are Basic Pokémon with 70HP, allowing them to be played straight from the hand and soak up damage early in the game. All have good damage to Energy cost ratios, with Hitmonchan able to deal 20 damage for <a href=# title=Fighting><img alt=Fighting src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/48/Fighting-attack.png/30px-Fighting-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>, and Electabuzz able to deal 10 damage and potentially inflict <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Paralyzed (TCG)">Paralysis</a> for <a href=# title=Lightning><img alt=Lightning src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/04/Lightning-attack.png/30px-Lightning-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>.</p><p>Trainer cards also factored heavily in Haymaker decks. Cards such as <a href=# title="Bill (Base Set 91)">Bill</a>, <a href=# title="Professor Oak (Base Set 88)">Professor Oak</a>, and <a href=# title="Computer Search (Base Set 71)">Computer Search</a> allowed cards to be drawn and quickly populate the Bench. <a href=# title="PlusPower (Base Set 84)">PlusPower</a> gave extra power to attacks, while <a href=# title="Energy Removal (Base Set 92)">Energy Removal</a> and <a href=# title="Super Energy Removal (Base Set 79)">Super Energy Removal</a> could disrupt the opponent's strategy. <a href=# title="Item Finder (Base Set 74)">Item Finder</a> was also useful in recycling Trainer cards.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Key_Cards>Key Cards</span></h2><ul><li><b><a href=# title="Electabuzz (Base Set 20)">Electabuzz</a></b> - The ability to Paralyze with <i>Thundershock</i> on turn 1 allowed Electabuzz to set up for <i>Thunderpunch</i> on turn 2, with the possibility of dealing 40 damage. Important for hitting the Weakness of <a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a>.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Hitmonchan (Base Set 7)">Hitmonchan</a></b> - Hitmonchan could use its <i>Jab</i> attack on turn 1 for 20 damage. Its second attack, <i>Special Punch</i>, could deal 40 damage for three Energy. Important for hitting the Weakness of many Colorless and most Lightning Pokémon.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Scyther (Jungle 10)">Scyther</a></b> - Primarily valued for its combination of 70 HP with Fighting Resistance and a free Retreat Cost. With the addition of <a href=# title="Double Colorless Energy (Base Set 96)">Double Colorless Energy</a>, Scyther could deal a consistent 30 damage from turn 2 with its <i>Slash</i> attack.</li><li><b><a href=# title="PlusPower (Base Set 84)">PlusPower</a></b> - Provides an additional 10 damage to a Pokémon's attack. <a href=# title="Gust of Wind (Base Set 93)">Gust of Wind</a> and matching Weakness, this allowed <a href=# title="Electabuzz (Base Set 20)">Electabuzz</a> to quickly OHKO most Basic Pokémon.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Energy Removal (Base Set 92)">Energy Removal</a></b> and <b><a href=# title="Super Energy Removal (Base Set 79)">Super Energy Removal</a></b> - Allows the player to discard Energy from opposing Pokémon, limiting most opponent's to low Energy attacks. This was vital to Haymaker; even though 70 HP was large for a Basic Pokémon, multiple Evolved Pokémon could still OHKO this amount. Between S/ER and Gust of Wind, they never got the chance.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Bill (Base Set 91)">Bill</a></b>, <b><a href=# title="Computer Search (Base Set 71)">Computer Search</a></b>, <b><a href=# title="Item Finder (Base Set 74)">Item Finder</a></b>, and <b><a href=# title="Professor Oak (Base Set 88)">Professor Oak</a></b> - Provides for the deck's draw and search needs, allowing the player to quickly setup. The usage of Bill was hotly debated, with the side in favor of it pointing out it made the deck faster and more consistent, while the side opposed preferred space for additional options and felt it both fast and consistent enough already. Item Finder was also often important late game, recycling a useful Trainer that had already been used several times or was discarded for other card effects.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Gust of Wind (Base Set 93)">Gust of Wind</a></b> - Controlling the opponent's Active could be used to stall for time, but it was mostly used to facilitate key KO's (preferably OHKO's) that would not only earn a Prize but weaken the opponent's own setup.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Scoop Up (Base Set 78)">Scoop Up</a></b> - This card was used to deal with damage and the effects of attacks (including what we now call Special Conditions). Though you had to discard the Energy currently attached to the Pokémon in question, judicious use of single Energy attacks, �Scyther (with its free Retreat Cost), and/or Super Energy Removal could reduce or even eliminate this drawback.</li></ul><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Typical_deck_list>Typical deck list</span></h2><p>The deck list appearing below is not official; it is meant to represent an average build of the archetype, not specifically constructed for any regional metagame.

So long as there is Energy in the discard pile, its <i>Energy Absorption</i> attack allows Mewtwo to set up quickly allowing players to choose up to 2 Energy cards from there.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Magmar (Fossil 39)">Magmar</a></b> - Good for stalling the opponent with its <i>Smokescreen</i> attack and 70HP, while its stronger attack, <i>Smog</i>, provides the opportunity to <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Poison (TCG)">Poison</a> the opposing Pokémon.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Energy Search (Fossil 59)">Energy Search</a></b> - This card would further thin the deck while snagging the exact basic Energy card needed. Some preferred to use the space for <a href=# title="Rainbow Energy (Team Rocket 17)">Rainbow Energy</a> or additional copies of the desired basic Energy.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Lass (Base Set 75)">Lass</a></b> - In a deck where any Trainer cards will be used up relatively quickly, Lass can be used to disrupt the opponent's strategy with little to no impact on the players'.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Switch (Base Set 95)">Switch</a></b> - This card was sometimes used as an alternative to running more copies of Scoop Up or Double Colorless Energy. Used well, it could help conserve Energy.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Nightly Garbage Run (Team Rocket 77)">Nightly Garbage Run</a></b> - Can be used to shuffle in energies and Pokémon from the discard pile to your deck which is useful when playing against decks such as Chansey/Alakazam stall. This card can put back the energies and Pokémon discarded by Item Finder and Computer Search.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Muk (Fossil 28)">Muk</a></b> - Muk is used for its ability Toxic Gas which is used for blocking useful abilities, such as Rain Dance on <a href=# title="Blastoise (Base Set 2)">Blastoise</a>.</li></ul><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Restriction>Restriction</span></h2><p>The Haymaker deck, being comprised mostly of cards made in the first few sets of the TCG, was one of the first to be essentially, but not explicitly, banned from play as the cards were taken out of <a href=# title="Play!
