Michel was convinced that she was possessed by a demon. She claimed to see the devil’s face wherever she went and heard demons whispering in her ears telling her to “rot in hell” and that she was “damned.”</p>Audio recording of Anneliese Michel during one of her exorcisms.<p>Michel and her parents were desperate for a solution to her affliction so they turned to a priest for help with non-medical treatments. For the next ten months, two priests conducted 67 exorcisms on Michel.</p><p>Throughout the exorcisms, the demons inside of Michel would compete for power over her body and would communicate&nbsp;through a low, guttural growl. Michel’s health steadily declined over this period until she eventually died of malnutrition and dehydration in 1976.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-135548 alt="Michel Genuflects On Broken Knees" width=620 height=440 data-sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/michel-genuflect-rose.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-135548 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Anneliese Michel/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Anneliese continuing to genuflect despite her broken knees.</span></p><p>Michel’s parents and the priests who performed the exorcisms on her were charged with negligent homicide for her death and the case became a national sensation in Germany.</p><p>For future horror movies based on true stories, one doesn’t have to look much further than Michel’s past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonypu9GrpqtlnaTDqrHSZpmaq5WZerC6jK2prp1dqMGwvsieqmhv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
