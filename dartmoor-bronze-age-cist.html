Thousands of years ago, someone was laid to rest in present-day Devon, England. Peat grew over their burial chamber as the centuries passed, obscuring it from view. But as the peat began to erode, archaeologists discovered the Bronze Age tomb anew."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They have not yet revealed its exact location out of concern that the public could damage it before it’s properly evaluated. But they are confident that it may be of historical significance, especially given that it could be 4,000 years old.</p><p>“We have every potential for this to be something quite special,” lead archaeologist Lee Bray explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Devon Live</a>. “We don’t know for certain if this is a cist, but it certainly looks like one. All the evidence we have points to it being a cist from the early Bronze Age.”</p><p>It’s not the first time the moors of the national park have yielded a historical treasure. In 2011, a woman’s burial chamber from 1700 B.C.E. was discovered at Whitehorse Hill.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490517 alt="Whitehorse Cist" width=810 height=539 data-sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/whitehorse-cist.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490517 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Dartmoor National Park Authority</span><span class=caption-body>Archaeologists excavating a cist found at Whitehorse Hill in Dartmoor in 2011.

First, archaeologists would need to scan the site with a laser to determine what it contained. Then, they would need to cut the cist out of the earth “like a piece of cake,” an endeavor which might also require a helicopter to airlift the cist off the moor.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490531 alt="Bog In Dartmoor" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bog-in-dartmoor.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490531 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Herby/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A bog in Dartmoor National Park.</span></p><p>Still, Bray says that an excavation of the burial chamber would be “better for archaeology and better for Dartmoor.”</p><p>So far, there’s support for an excavation of the cist. Dartmoor National Park Authority allocated £90,000 ($114,500) for an excavation, and member Andrew Cooper told an authority meeting, “There’s no gain without pain.”</p><p>He continued: “Now we know what Whitehorse Hill did for Dartmoor, I don’t think we’ve got any other option. We might end up with peat on our faces because there’s nothing there, but you never know unless you try.”</p><p>After reading about the potential Bronze Age burial chamber found in England, discover the story of the <a href=#>Druids</a>, the Celtic priests of the ancient world.
