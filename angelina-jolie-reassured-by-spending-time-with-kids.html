Angelina Jolie is dedicated to her children
The ‘Eternals’ actress – who has Maddox, 19, Pax, 18, Zahara, 17, Shiloh, 16, and 13-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne with ex-husband Brad Pitt – turns to her brood when she’s having “doubts” and seeing how they have all grown up as “good people” allows her to see herself through their eyes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You don’t know what ‘you’ is, it’s not really about your life anymore, and so you want to represent them, you want to be that model for them, your best self.”</p><p>And the ‘Tomb Raider’ star is still “figuring out” her own life in the wake of her divorce from Brad.</p><p>She said: “All of us struggle because no one is a perfect person so we’re just putting ourselves in check to ask, are we coming from the right place? And there’s no end to that growth.”</p><p>While Angelina is well known for her humanitarian work, she doesn’t want to over-burden her own children with the problems of the world, and thinks they need some “silliness” in their lives to counteract the constant news cycle.</p><p>She said: “They are more connected than any generation has ever been, and with that comes an overload of information about the world we’re living in – some very frightening things and they’re exposed to all of them.</p><p>“They’re being encouraged to do something about it, which is wonderful because it gives them agency, but also, they shouldn’t feel that pressure.</p><p>“The biggest challenge for this generation is just trying to help them seek joy and find peace… they need some silliness and rebellion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqWgnZyeu6J5yaijop1dp7Kiv9KuqZ6cXZfGbr%2FPnqWdoZ6cerW1zJ5ksKGknXqstcOsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
