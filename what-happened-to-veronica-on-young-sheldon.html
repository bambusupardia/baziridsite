He’s been in and out of relationships and has been divorced more than once, noting that he married his first wife when he was just 19 years old. It’s unknown who this first wife is, hence why the belief has arisen that it could be Veronica Duncan should they end up back in each other’s lives.</p><p>While this would be great for the fans who are still salty about Veronica’s sudden farewell, others aren’t convinced she and George will tie the knot. Redditor&nbsp;u/emmawert posited that it’s more plausible that George and Mandy will marry instead of him and Veronica. They point to George Sr. (Lance Barber), who is opposed to them being together and dies when George Jr. is 19. Thus, his death would give them an opportunity to get married. Some in the comments agreed, others vouched for Veronica, and some even speculated that George Jr.’s first wife could be someone else entirely.</p><p>Veronica Duncan doesn’t spend long on “Young Sheldon,” but considering how often she’s discussed by fans of the show, she more than makes her mark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHmqtmoJGlvaa6xJ1kraddq7Kzu82imppln6N6urvUp55mq5iauaW7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
