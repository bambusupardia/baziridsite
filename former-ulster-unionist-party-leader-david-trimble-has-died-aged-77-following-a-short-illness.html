class=mol-para-with-font>It was at the university in 1983 that he heard the IRA’s gunshots which killed his fellow law professor and UUP colleague Edgar Graham and later identified the body.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He left academia for politics full time when he was elected as MP for Upper Bann following a by election in 1990 after the death of the incumbent Harold McCusker.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lord Trimble rose to prominence partly due to the Drumcree dispute as nationalist residents opposed the procession of an orange parade along the Garvaghy Road.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He led the parade along the road in 1995, famously joining hands with Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few months later, Lord Trimble unexpectedly won the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party over the favourite Lord Kilclooney, starting his often turbulent time at the helm of the party.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He marked a number of firsts as Ulster Unionist leader, including becoming the party’s first leader in 30 years to meet with the Irish premier in Dublin and in 1997 he became the first unionist leader since partition to negotiate with Sinn Fein.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The peace talks, which started formally in 1998 under the chairmanship of former US senator George Mitchell, saw many nights of
