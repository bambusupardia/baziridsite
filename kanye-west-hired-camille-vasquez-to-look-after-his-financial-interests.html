Earlier this month, the Donda founder was chastised for wearing a ‚ÄúWhite Lives Matter‚Äù t-shirt to the Yeezy presentation during Paris Fashion Week. Soon after, he made many anti-Semitic statements on social media, prompting the suspension of his Instagram and Twitter accounts. West has also been sued for $250 million for making inflammatory remarks concerning the death of George Floyd.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Camille-Vasquez-1.jpg alt="Camille Vasquez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During an appearance on Drink Champs, the singer claimed Floyd died as a result of a fentanyl overdose rather than Derek Chauvin‚Äôs physical attack. The rapper‚Äôs words generated even more uproar.&nbsp;Following the incidents, Balenciaga announced the termination of all relations with the West. According to a brand statement:</p><p>‚ÄúBalenciaga no longer has any affiliation with this artist, nor any intentions for future collaborations including this artist.‚Äù</p><p>West also had a falling out with Gap and ended his contract with the company before Paris Fashion Week, while also criticizing Adidas. Needless to say, the rapper hired a legal team, including Camille Vasquez, to investigate his company in the midst of his continuous problems.&nbsp;Vasquez rose to prominence after defending Johnny Depp in his defamation action against Amber Heard. The lawyer was a social media phenomenon after playing a significant part in Depp‚Äôs triumph.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kanye-West-1.jpg alt="Kanye West" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter users react to Kanye West‚Äôs employment of Camille Vasquez</h2><p>Kanye West‚Äôs newest problems have included the ‚ÄúWhite Lives Matter‚Äù t-shirt, anti-Semitic slurs, comments about George Floyd‚Äôs murder, and conflict with businesses such as Balenciaga and Adidas.&nbsp;West allegedly hired Johnny Depp‚Äôs defamation trial prominent lawyer Camille Vasquez to handle his ‚Äúcommercial interests‚Äù in the aftermath of his legal and personal problems. Several social media users were taken aback by the appointment, and many rushed to Twitter to express their displeasure:</p><p dir=ltr lang=es>Esto no lo esperaba üò≥</p><p>Kanye West contrat√≥ a Camille V√°squez para que sea otra de sus abogadas y afrontar la ola de demandas que ha recibido recientemente. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cgVxu0F5LA</a></p><p>‚Äî Mario Mojica Cuello (@mariomojc) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 22, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Kanye West has hired Johnny Depp‚Äôs lawyer Camille Vasquez, TMZ reports. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/S4WQKVKfhL</a></p><p>‚Äî Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2022</a></p><p>As internet opinions continue to stream in, it remains to be seen if Kanye West or Camille Vasquez will formally declare their legal partnership in the coming days.&nbsp;West has reportedly recruited Melinda Gates‚Äô old divorce attorney Bob Cohen to defend him in his pending divorce from Kim Kardashian, according to TMZ. However, Vasquez and her staff are not expected to be engaged in the case.&nbsp;If Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cannot reach a deal by December 2022, their divorce will allegedly go to trial.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtZKGhopqxbq%2FApqClpJViw6K%2F0K6cs2WkpHqtu86kZJqepJq%2FbrTIrGSfoZ6Wu6S1wKVkoqakmr%2Bmv9OsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
