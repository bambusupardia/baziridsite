Griffin Matthews, who plays undercover CIA agent Shane in the show’s second season, recently revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>&nbsp;that he struggled with many of the scenes that required him to act over the phone. The actor admitted to taking inspiration from the Netflix show&nbsp;You.&nbsp;</p><p>“One of our directors, Silver Tree, is a producer on&nbsp;You,” Matthews said. “There were so many phone calls on&nbsp;You&nbsp;this season, and I said ‘What did you guys do?’ and she said sometimes she’d sit at the foot of the camera and just talk. It’s wild to do them because they look effortless if they’re well done.”&nbsp;</p><p>The actor noted that he utilized Tree’s experience working with Penn Badgley on the Netflix show to influence his decisions as an actor for&nbsp;The Flight Attendant. He&nbsp;also relied on some technological tricks to help him in the phone scenes. “There would be a little radio in my ear, so I was hearing a recording of Kaley or one of the other characters,” he said.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-season-2-of-the-flight-attendant-about>What is Season 2 of ‘The Flight Attendant’ about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=3.3228346456693><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8sEO07n7wg</a><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8sEO07n7wg?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>The character of Shane isn’t the only new face in the second season of&nbsp;The Flight Attendant.
