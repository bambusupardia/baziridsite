Shaneika Joyner and six-year-old India filmed the bizarre ‘UFO’ while waiting at a set of traffic lights in South Carolina. The pair were driving on Highway 52 in Goose Creek when they spotted a small dark grey object floating in front of them.
Shaneika managed to capture footage of the peculiar item flying through the sky."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, some have said they believe it’s a cloaked ship.”</p><p>Shaneika’s footage sparked debate after being uploaded online, with speculating commenter’s explanations ranging wildly.</p><p>One person said: “Drone with cloaking tech.”</p><p>Another asked: “Lower atmospheric cloud caught in a back-wind?”</p><p>However, one commented: “That’s a damn plastic bag.”</p><h2>‘NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT’</h2><p>Dismissed as a conspiracy theory for decades, ex-US defence officials, sitting politicians, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have all acknowledged there is something unusual going on in our skies.</p><p>Speculation among UFO fans has been running rife as lawmakers and officials have hinted at potentially significant information compiled in the classified section of Pentagon’s landmark report on alien activity.</p><p>US officials released the highly anticipated public document after giving a secret briefing to Congress two weeks ago – but now everyone is asking, what is in the full version of the dossier?</p><p>Richard Dolan, an American historian who has researched the topic for 25 years, claims one of his sources provided him with details apparently in the section that was briefed to certain US Congressmen and US Senators.</p><p>He alleged the classified portion was 70 pages long and included information about advanced – and potentially alien – propulsion systems and experimental craft using the tech that are <a href=#>being tested at Area 51</a>.</p><p>However, he made clear the information was “unconfirmed”.</p><p>Meanwhile, UFO researcher and professor Bob McGwier claimed 14 videos were shown in the classified briefing – describing it as like a “science fiction movie”.</p><p>He claimed officials redacted everything they could from the report – which saw the public version slashed to just nine pages.</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>What is going on with UFOs in the US?</h3><p>UFOS have stepped from fringe conspiracy theories to a genuine national security debate in the US.</p><p>Pentagon officials last year took the unprecedented step to confirm a trio of remarkable videos which showed US encounters with UFOs.</p><p>The debate is still open as to what the phenomena caught on film were – but it made clear to everyone, something is in the skies.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the “Tic Tac” – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes.</p><p>The US also confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) – a Pentagon programme set up to study UFOs before being disbanded in 2017.</p><p>However, it was replaced by the UAP Task Force in June 2020 after a vote by the US Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Defence chiefs have since confirmed a number of leaked UFO videos and photos which were submitted to the Task Force for investigation.</p><p>Why this sudden rush for transparency?</p><p>No outside the secretive wings of the US government currently knows for sure.</p><p>And as a tacked-on addendum to a 5,500 page Covid relief bill passed in December, the the Director of National Intelligence’s office was ordered to compile a report on UFOs within 180 days.</p><p>The UAP report dropped as expected on June 25, and while not giving much away – it did not rule anything out either as much of it remains classified.</p><p>The US appear to have acknowledged that UFOs – whatever they are – are real and are a potential threat to national security as they appear to be able to enter restricted airspace with total impunity.</p><p>Is it aliens? Officially the US position is simply, “we don’t know yet” as further disclosure is expected in the coming months and years.</p><p>The dossier did however admit there is something in the skies that cannot be explained – and did not rule out a potential alien origin.</p><p>It also revealed the US military cannot explain 143 out of 144 of sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).</p><p>The report – officially titled “Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” –&nbsp;was ordered by Congress as a tacked-on addendum to a Covid relief bill in December.</p><p>It was commissioned after the Pentagon took the extraordinary step of confirmed a trio of stunning videos showing encounters with pilots – admitting they could not explain the phenomena.</p><p>NASA chief Bill Nelson also said last week he has also read the classified version of the report, but didn’t gave much intel.</p><p>“It says basically what we thought.
