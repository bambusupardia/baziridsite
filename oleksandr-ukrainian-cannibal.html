On April 13, 2020, a 41-year-old Ukrainian man identified only as Oleksandr hosted a house party with his unidentified 50-year-old girlfriend. After finding human remains the next morning, police entered the residence on a tip and found Oleksandr in the middle of frying and eating his girlfriend’s legs. According to The Daily Mail, the man didn’t make any qualms about his meal and admitted openly that he “cooked his girlfriend’s legs and ate them after getting hungry."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He dragged the sack to the river and left it in the reeds.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275803 alt="House Of Ukrainian Cannibal Oleksandr" width=864 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/house-of-ukrainian-cannibal-oleksandr-e1587576968183.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275803 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ICTV</span><span class=caption-body>Oleksandr’s home in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine.</span></p><p>The couple was purportedly happily imbibing after the party when Oleksandr grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the girlfriend’s throat suddenly and with no clear motivation.</p><p>What followed was a series of gruesome events so macabre they might seem purely fictional.</p><p>After Oleksandr confirmed that his girlfriend was dead, he hacked her legs off, stuffed the rest of her into a large sack, and dragged her into the bush 1,600 feet from his house near the Inhulets River.

I called the police.”</p><p>It didn’t take a lot of work for locals to identify the victim, who then pointed police toward the house of the woman’s boyfriend. This is when officers stepped inside the residence and caught Oleksandr preparing the woman’s leg in a frying pan. After he ate some, police placed him under arrest.</p><p>Police reportedly felt ill after taking in the scene.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-275827 alt="Pants Of Oleksandr's Victim" width=482 height=482 data-sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pants-of-oleksandrs-victim.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-275827 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ICTV</span><span class=caption-body>Oleksandr didn’t make an effort to hide any evidence, and simply left his victim’s pants lying in the courtyard.</span></p><p>Ultimately, the investigation into Oleksandr continues. The cannibal is currently in custody and charged with murder. Authorities naturally need to assess whether or not he acted alone before moving forward with his case.</p><p>Oleksandr is currently facing up to 15 years in prison if he is found guilty.
