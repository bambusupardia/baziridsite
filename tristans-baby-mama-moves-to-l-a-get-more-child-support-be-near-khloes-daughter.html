One could be California’s much more generous child support laws. MTO News did some research and<strong> California is one of the few states that does not put a cap on how much child support a parent has to pay. </strong>The amount you have to pay in California is a legal calculation based on wages and income, custody time, and other key factors.</p><p>Under California law, 25% of the non-custodial parent’s income to be paid in child support to the custodial parent. Tristan Thompson makes $20M this year, so Maralee could be entitled to as much as $5M a year in support.</p><p>Contrast that with Texas’ child support laws. Texas puts a cap on child support – it changed in September 2019, going from $8,550 to $9,200.</p><p>So she could have stayed in Texas and got $10K or moved to Cali and got $5M. Seems like a good move to us.</p><p>Another benefit to moving to Cali is that Maralee’s son can grow up near his sister True – Khloe’s daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOramiq6SWu7R5wZqZsmWdlrqiecyorZ6rXam8briMmmSgnaRiurC%2BxGaaoaGcmXq0wc%2BppqusXZeybrrEmqlmo5ihvKa%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
