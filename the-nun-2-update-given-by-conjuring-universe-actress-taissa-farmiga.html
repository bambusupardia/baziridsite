As one of the many spinoffs of&nbsp;The Conjuring,&nbsp;there has been ongoing speculation on when a follow-up to the 2018 horror film&nbsp;would be&nbsp;green-lit. Farmiga starred in&nbsp;The Nun as Sister Irene, who is summoned to help investigate the suicide of a young nun in Romania, which leads to an unspeakable demonic force. The Nun&nbsp;currently stands as the <a href=#>highest-grossing installment in The Conjuring Universe</a>.</p><p>The Farmiga name is certainly no stranger to The Conjuring Universe as Taissa’s oldest sister Vera Farmiga has starred in&nbsp;The Conjuring trilogy as real-life paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren. With the first film,&nbsp;The Conjuring,&nbsp;directed by James Wan, kicking off the shared horror franchise&nbsp;in 2013,&nbsp;The Nun is one of three spinoffs&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;Annabelle and The Curse of La Llorona. Since then, The Conjuring Universe&nbsp;has become the most <a href=#>financially successful cinematic universe from Warner Bros.</a>, even&nbsp;topping DC and The Wizarding World.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why The Nun Is Still The Highest Grossing Conjuring Universe Film</a></span></p><p>Farmiga was interviewed&nbsp;by THR&nbsp;about new updates on The Nun sequel and if her character could be related to her sister Vera’s character&nbsp;from the previous films, or even a younger version of her. On the subject of&nbsp;her audition for the original film and speaking with director Corin Hardy, Farmiga mentioned that there was never any clarification on what Sister Irene’s last name could be. As for what’s happening with the sequel, Farmiga had this to say:</p><p>“There have definitely been whisperings and talks in the last year, but the pandemic has obviously affected everything including filming and such. So I heard mentions of it back in the fall, maybe, and there were talks of potentially trying to see what my availability was. But I also haven’t seen a script. So I haven’t heard anything definitive or anyone say, ‘Hey, this is going.’ So I don’t know, but I would love to go back and visit Sister Irene. It’s been years.”</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Even though The Nun&nbsp;was a box office hit, the critical response was hugely negative&nbsp;compared to its predecessors in The Conjuring Universe. Nevertheless, franchise producer <a href=#>Peter Safran has spoken about the sequel’s development</a> and that it has a “really fun story”&nbsp;planned. Since The Nun took place years before the events of the first Conjuring film, there is still plenty of room for Farmiga’s Sister&nbsp;Irene to return and face off against Valak, the titular sinister Nun, once again.</p><p>It’s been no secret that the pandemic affected so much in the film industry&nbsp;as well as the rest of the world. Whether or not fans of The Conjuring Universe even think that The Nun should get a sequel due to its panned reception,&nbsp;Farmiga has made it clear that the folks at WB are still bound to make it happen and would love to return. If all goes well, the&nbsp;sequel could even fare better than the original. If it happened with Annabelle: Creation, it can happen with <strong>The Nun 2</strong>.</p><p><span class=next-single>More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Horror Movie Trailers Ruin Big Scares: Why It Happens (& Why It’s Bad)</a></span></p><p><span class=affiliate-single>Source: THR</span></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Guillermo del Toro Explains Why Spielberg’s West Side Story Gym Scene Is Genius</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/drive.google.com/drive/my-drivedoc-10-1o-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/nugf5p6fr3ucnnemuctvsd6fq3r5m51n/e1fejp1n7fp45h25cg7a4vn30lft87n1/1645169325000/05707935795628561203/05707935795628561203/1RAzP5tTTjIMTzKn5XSlPSqYSVi7Mpj1s?e=download&ax=ACxEAsbFBVOvhLA0vJ5_ZPfs3rwoKUpsVWyCa7YRMG6cWo0QZojBR1UXOqGnuvUxPC9a_OnXLYaril--yd-vYiJ_XmotaRPRWsU3u1wtrWealvEtWdTYt5Vh5aJRMlwJFqtmTF5F7fcLH448nnkpaL-4cd3dIlzDMLYqu2_gjtBS9xqBdOlm6JHKKSpP2sLvxzYk4jDVD3_rJ1miarOFLFYXjDrH85MByES25ZmJyBz1ncI6w4gPG9mz6kzKItTHCKo5wGGCk5HAbiDSdNJIEeqQsNhReXd07ZhLEDKI6zoc8geZFgRIcQeFe6QhcDI1gnYbO946jhNJt6fvVR7-TcfDgz963e8H5OnngIKT5Fc3aMmwsw6G5B76-pvTlp5ZF85vtGHiZrw0SuRueZTTdS_HZLUIR8hPG4DXI7U6VjEZWgjdsN1T0i9XzGqjFpsy-RYQ9P4-0vG61i3_2FutHh3DkBUNB5_EBZySqropgISCIbwbqZJemQAl7z_ryuimKXlVVV9FWqNZuYFyAmjJ-_xgmCuFxWkLZel6o59P7WsRtCHbE6LeUH1tqHZH6zB8nAfm2pmubuc9VEwgs4hRkXYedg-7g6p_yMWFI6gwr21ntIGzOYirZ88Bemqo4Sad-obCdZdZRhS1975emcsNV1Ey6_tG7y6OCc8GFsutzPw&authuser=0&nonce=hk1men7jppmq2&user=05707935795628561203&hash=5vr630mcajd3ub1m32ojekkrvg40p89f?fit=crop&amp;amp;w=60&amp;amp;h=60" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Paul Zecharia<br><span class=amount>(5 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Paul Zecharia is an Entertainment News Writer for Screen Rant.
