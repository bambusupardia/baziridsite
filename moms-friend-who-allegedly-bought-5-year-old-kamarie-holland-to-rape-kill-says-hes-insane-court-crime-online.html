However, even if a jury were to agree with Williams’ plea, he would not be allowed to walk free. He would be sent to an institution for the criminally insane, according to Russell County Chief Assistant District Attorney Rick Chancey.</p><p>If found guilty of the charges, Williams could face the death penalty.</p><p>Due to a backlog of requests in the state, it’s unclear when Williams will receive his evaluation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/co-a2.freetls.fastly.net/co-uploads/2021/12/Kristy-Siple-2.jpg><p>As CrimeOnline previously reported, Kamarie was last seen around Bowman Street in Columbus, Georgia, on December 13, 2021. Police labeled Kamarie as “critically missing” but no further details were initially released.</p><p>The following day, police confirmed that the child was found deceased at a home in Phenix, Alabama, where Williams once lived. Williams landed on police radar early on in the investigation.&nbsp;Police arrested Williams at an Alabama hotel shortly after locating Kamarie’s body.</p><p>Kamari’s mother, 35-year-old Kelly Siple, allegedly sold 6-year-old Kamari to Williams. The defendant paid Siple for sex with the girl and Siple knowingly provided the girl in exchange for “sexual servitude,” an arrest warrant states. Siple and Williams reportedly had a previous relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/co-a2.freetls.fastly.net/co-uploads/2022/03/Kamari-Holland-1-.jpg><p>Siple, also referred to as Kristy Hoskins, went on local television in Columbus, Georgia, in December, claiming that Kamarie was “her life” and professing innocence. Siple had donated the girl’s toys to WTVM-TV’s annual holiday toy drive and was interviewed by a reporter about the donation.</p><p>She’s now been indicted on murder and human trafficking charges by grand jurors in Russell County, Alabama.</p><p>According to court documents, after Siple sold Kamari to Williams, he took the girl from her home in Georgia to an Alabama home he previously lived at. Siple reported her daughter missing on December 13, claiming that she awoke and discovered that the front door of her home had been open.</p><p>Al.com reports that the recently-revealed court documents indicate that Williams&nbsp;“recorded himself raping and sodomizing” the child’s corpse&nbsp;“after having caused her death by strangulation.”</p><p>In the wake of the allegations, Columbus Assistant Police Chief Joyce Dent-Fitzpatrick cautioned parents to be vigilant about who is around their children.</p><p>“This has really struck a nerve for all of us because&nbsp;we really care about our kids and our community,” Dent-Fitzpatrick told WRBL-TV. “The only thing I have to say is, please monitor where your kids are and who they are around.”</p><p>The case continues.
