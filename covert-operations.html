In the 1960s, the CIA devised an outlandish — but possibly brilliant — idea. What if they could fit a cat with spying technology and train it to cozy up to Soviet officials? With that, Operation Acoustic Kitty was born.
According to Smithsonian Magazine, the project took five years and $20 million dollars to get off the ground."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That cat in question was a largely unwilling subject, who exhibited the cat-like tendency of wandering off wherever it wanted to, whenever it wanted to. Still, the CIA was determined to test out their new technology.</p><p>Agents brought their feline spy to a park, where they hoped it would sit near two men on a bench and pick up their conversation. Instead, the cat dashed off, ran into the road, and was promptly hit and killed by a taxi. In 1967, the CIA officially ended Operation Acoustic Kitty.</p><p>“Our final examination of trained cats… convinced us that the program would not lend itself in a practical sense to our highly specialized needs,” CIA analysts admitted in a heavily redacted memo about the covert operation, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>History</a>.</p><p>However, perhaps hoping to justify a $20 million price tag, the memo also noted that Operation Acoustic Kitty had proved that: “cats can indeed be trained to move short distances… in itself a remarkable scientific achievement.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyku9Weqa1ln6Wys63Toqanq19q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
