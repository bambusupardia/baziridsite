No opinion changes a fact and we got the history to prove that. If you know me you know how I’m coming ’bout her.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/12/monica4.jpg alt width=640 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#>Monica</a> and C-Murder dated several years ago. The ‘Angel Of Mine’ singer recently rallied to get Kim Kardashian involved with her good friend’s legal case, which has discrepancies that could lead to his release from prison. C-Murder was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 16-year-old Steven Thomas in 2009.</p><p>The recording artist was found liable for the teen’s death. Two key witnesses in the case, however, refuted their testimonies and admitted that police and prosecutors pressured them into indicating C-Murder as the guilty party. C-Murder has always maintained his innocence and even called his brother, Master P, out for allegedly failing to support him through the entire process.</p><p><a href=#>Master P</a> recently took to social media to refute accusations of abandonment. The businessman told his supporters that he consistently visited his brother in prison while also providing financial support to C-Murder and other members of the family. Master P concluded his video by telling fans that he would no longer support his extended family to the degree that he once gave help.</p><p>Chanelle Miller started the “Free Corey Miller” petition, which has garnered nearly 19,000 of the 25,000 needed signatures to date. You can learn more about the campaign to have C-Murder’s case overturned here.</p><p>Photo: Laiyah Brown/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmampfZoJwuc6noJyZXaW8tLHSZq6irJhisaLBxqGrnqpdlrulecJmpK6qlJq%2FtHnKopusZZmjeq%2Bx1manoaekpHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
