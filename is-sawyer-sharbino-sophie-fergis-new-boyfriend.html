To keep her followers interested, the model created a content mill based on her daily routine and the challenges she faces. For obvious reasons, who is Sophie Fergi’s boyfriend?</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=131>Is Sawyer Sharbino Sophie Fergi’s New Boyfriend</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=132>Internet reports in 2021 claimed Fergi and TikToker Sawyer Sharbino were more than buddies. Fergi declared on TikTok on August 13, 2021, that Sharbino was her new boyfriend. Even more convincing was the fact that they’d appeared in numerous videos together, as well as on their own. Piper Rockelle, an actress/singer/YouTuber, led the group known as “The Squad,” which included these young people.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=136>“We’ve got some big news to tell you,” the captions read in the video accompanying the post. After a short time, they announced their relationship status: “We’re dating,” the couple captioned a video of Fergi clinging to her presumed boyfriend. Long-time fans of Sharbino were skeptical, despite receiving confirmation from the horse’s mouth because they believed that he was currently dating Emily Dobson. There is nothing surprising about the fact that fans were correct all along. “Dating My Best Friend!” was posted on Sharbino’s YouTube channel just over a week after Fergi made the TikTok disclosure. Sadie Fergi and Sawyer Sharbino perform together on this song. All along, it had been for a video.</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=142>Sophie Fergi Left Her Squad And Her Ex-Boyfriend</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=143>If you’ve been following any of the Squad members’ social media accounts, there is no surprise in the fact that Fergi was once engaged to Jentzen Ramirez. For a long time, they were adored by the public as a couple. During the shipping process, they were referred to as “Sophie.”</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=145>Fergi and her ex-boyfriend split up in August 2020, and in order to be open and honest with their fans, each of them released a YouTube video detailing their side of the story. That the two of them decided to end their relationship mutually was revealed in a video on Ramirez’s YouTube channel.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=147>The breakup was caused, he claims, by Fergi’s parents, who “didn’t really want her dating at this time.” She claimed in a YouTube video that her parents had never objected to her relationship with Ramirez. Contrary to this, she insisted that her mother and the rest of her family were fine with the relationship. Fergi ended her friendship with Piper Rockelle and the rest of the Squad after their breakup. The public, on the other hand, is unaware of the nature of the split.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=151>On the other hand, Fergi has always wished the best for her former colleagues. According to Distractify, the entire squad blocked Piper Rockelle from all social media accounts.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWjlsS6sdFmqqGZope2r7uMrKapoJmaeqex0aCgrGWemsRurs6ynauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
