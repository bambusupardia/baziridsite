There has not been a lot of talk about who the next man of the hour will be. However, the synopsis for After the Final Rose, states the new&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;will make his debut.&nbsp;Reality Steve&nbsp;weighed in on who he thinks will be the lucky man to get the role of a lifetime. Keep reading to find out more.</p><h3>Reality Steve&nbsp;weighs in on&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;2024 speculation</h3><p>Reality Steve<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;</a>usually figures out the news before it’s publicly announced. However, this time he’s not 100% sure and has not gotten confirmation he needs to be certain. This hasn’t stopped him from weighing in on the potential prospects.</p><p>Fans of course have their own varied opinions about who should be the next lead. The majority seem to think Joey Graziadei is the leading choice assuming he doesn’t win&nbsp;The Bachelorette.&nbsp;There are also many fans who want to see Dotun Olubeko as&nbsp;The Bachelor.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Charity-Lawson-via-youtube-23.jpg></p><p>Those who follow spoilers know which of these two men Steve has said wins Charity’s heart. Both have won over Bachelor Nation and are deemed good guys. The fact that Dotun had no idea there was supposed to be a proposal at the end of the show made everyone’s jaws drop. Even better it seems like he is ready to get down on one knee.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Charity-and-Dotun-via-insta-.jpg></p><h3>Who will it be?</h3><p>Nobody has a solid answer just yet. However, Steve feels that the way they have portrayed Joey makes him a perfect candidate for the job. The professional tennis player seems sincere and ready to find his person. Fans everywhere have been commenting that if he doesn’t win that he should get the role of&nbsp;The Bachelor.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the show has been sneaky before and pulled in someone nobody expected. Two examples of that were Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Nick Viall. These two were not on the season prior to filming. Both were alums who didn’t have things work out with&nbsp;The Bachelorette.&nbsp;Plus, Nick was actually on&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;when he was announced as the lead. Another example was Clayton Echard.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Charity-and-Joey-via-Insta-1.jpg></p><p>So, right now it’s anybody’s guess who the official man will be. Producers have also been known to change their minds last minute.</p><p>Most believe it will be Joey cast as&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;2024. What do you think?</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p><img alt height=250 width=250 decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f1b5671b1ae7d4cfaeeeca732654db88?s=500&r=g2x" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Jamie is a Nurse and a mom of boys whose true passion is writing.
