Sign up for The Eat Index, our weekly food newsletter, and find out where to eat and get the latest restaurant happenings in Orange County. <a href=#>Subscribe here</a>.<p>“While we strive to present a menu that is rooting in carefully sourced ingredients and time-intensive preparation, we are intent on being approachable, affordable and craveable,” said Crema Bakery owner and Chief Executive Baker Tarit Tanjasiri.</p><p>The new European style restaurant aims to be reminiscent of a Parisian boulangerie with a display of fresh-baked breads and pastries. The space “is meant to replicate the feeling of being invited into a friend’s home with dining room décor that is inviting and comfortable.”</p><p>Executive Chef Chad Urata will offer items such as the Perfect Omelette, Parisian Eggs Benedict, avocado toast, bacon and egg sandwich and Mochiko Chicken Sandwich. Baked goods, made fresh daily, will include&nbsp; breads, croissants, cookies, macarons and the Artisan Croffle — a croissant and waffle mashup.</p><p>7 Leaves will put its signature on the beverage side of the menu with Sea Cream Jasmine, Japanese Matcha, Summer Mint, Sunset Passion and Strawberry Hibiscus teas as well as green and red Thai teas. The menu also will include barista-driven <a href=#>coffee and espresso drinks,</a> such as Sea Cream Black Coffee and a Honey Vanilla Latte.</p><p><strong>Find it:</strong> 10065 Garfield Ave., Fountain Valley, 657-229-4349, <a href=#>7leavescafe.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Open:</strong> Currently, Artisan offers drive-through service with a limited menu. Once it opens on Saturday, July, 24 with the full menu, hours will be 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKy8brzOqaylmaJiv6a%2F05qsq5meqcBuwMSapGatoGLBsHnCq5yarJVirrPAyKyYp2WZo3qnu9Snq5qhnmLDorjLnrBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
