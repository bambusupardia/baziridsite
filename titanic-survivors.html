The only Japanese person aboard the Titanic, Masabumi Hosono ultimately endured the scorn of his countrymen for taking a spot on a lifeboat and not going down with the ship.
At the time of the collision, Honoso was asleep in his cabin. He woke to a frantic knock on the door and the sound of footsteps in the hallway.
