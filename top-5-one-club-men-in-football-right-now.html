Loyalty in football is difficult to come by these days. However, it is difficult to blame any individual for this; in a short professional career, it makes sense to prioritize career and money over loyalty.
Certain players, however, have managed to stick around despite the ups and downs of their respective clubs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, it is difficult to blame any individual for this; in a short professional career, it makes sense to prioritize career and money over loyalty.</p><p>Certain players, however, have managed to stick around despite the ups and downs of their respective clubs. These players have become legends at their respective clubs. They will undoubtedly be remembered as some of the greatest players to have ever represented the team.</p><p>We take a look at the top five one-club men in football right now.</p><h2>Number 5: Mark Noble&nbsp; (West Ham United)</h2><p><strong>Mark Noble</strong>, dubbed “Mr. West Ham,” has been one of the club’s best players in recent years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mark-Noble.jpg><p>Noble is regarded as a West Ham United legend. Since making his West Ham debut in 2004, the midfielder has made 535 appearances in all competitions, scoring 60 goals and providing 60 assists. Noble has been with the club through thick and thin, having played in both the Championship and the Premier League.</p><p>Noble is well-known for his ability to take penalties. The 34-year-old deserved to be capped by England at some point in his career. Noble’s final season as a player begins this season; he announced earlier this year that he would retire at the end of the 2021-22 season.</p><h2>Number 4: Nacho (Real Madrid)</h2><p><strong>Nacho</strong> will never be considered a first-choice defender for Real Madrid. Previously, in the pecking order, Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane were ahead of Eder Militao and David Alaba.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nacho.jpg><p>Nacho has been a consistent presence for Los Blancos for quite some time. He made his Real Madrid debut in 2011 after graduating from the club’s youth system. The Spain international has made 244 appearances for his club in all competitions and has played in various defensive positions.</p><p>Nacho is primarily a center-back, but he can also play both full-back positions if necessary. The 31-year-old appears content with his life at Real Madrid, and his importance has grown in recent seasons.</p><h2>Number 3: Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)</h2><p><strong>Harry Kane</strong> appeared to be on his way out of Tottenham Hotspur this summer, with Manchester City circling the superstar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Harry-Kane-1.jpg><p>Many consider Kane to be the best striker in the world, and he is the pride of Tottenham Hotspur. The England international is a product of the club’s academy and has made 352 appearances for the club in all competitions. For the Spurs, he has 228 goals and 51 assists.</p><p>Kane has three Premier League Golden Boots and one Premier League Playmaker of the Season to his name. The 28-year-old was reportedly keen on joining Manchester City this summer. After missing out on his dream move, the striker has had a quiet start to the season.</p><h2>Number 2: Sergio Busquets (Barcelona)</h2><p><strong>Sergio Busquets</strong>, arguably the greatest defensive midfielder in history, has had incredible success at the highest level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sergio-Busquets.jpg><p><strong>Busquets</strong> attended Barcelona’s renowned La Masia academy. Over the years, the Spain international has played an important role for both Barcelona and his country. Throughout his illustrious career, he has won eight La Liga titles, three Champions League trophies, a World Cup, and a European Championship.</p><p>The 33-year-old isn’t known for his physicality. Busquets is a highly intelligent footballer who has made a name for himself as an excellent game reader. Busquets, who is technically gifted and highly regarded by his teammates, currently captains both Barcelona and the Spanish national team.</p><h2>Number 1: Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich)</h2><p>The Raumdeuter remains a highly effective footballer, confounding opponents with his unconventional style of play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Thomas-Muller.jpeg><p><strong>Thomas Muller</strong> is a one-of-a-kind footballer. He is not visually appealing, but he is one of the best players in the world. The Germany international is an incredibly versatile forward who has made 599 appearances in all competitions for Bayern Munich. He’s scored 220 goals and provided an incredible 230 assists.</p><p>Muller, an astute observer of space, has mastered the art of being in the right place at the right time. Although he lacks physicality, Muller’s technical ability and understanding of the game have helped him become one of Bayern Munich’s all-time greats.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqwusRmmqWtkmK6prqMoqVmnp%2BkwaOty6Vkq6GXncFuus6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
