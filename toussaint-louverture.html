Haiti had its independence back.</p><p>This, too, came at a cost. In the years following Haitian independence, European powers did not recognize the republic and France eventually succeeded in levying a crippling tax on Haiti as the price of its independence.</p><p>Ever since, Western powers have continued to meddle in Haitian political life right up until the present, often with devastatingly negative consequences: today, the island nation is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 80 percent of residents living below the poverty line.</p><p>Only time will tell whether the spirit of Toussaint Louverture will again arise and bring Haiti once more to the forefront of the oppressed’s struggle for justice and freedom.</p><p>After learning about Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolution, read up on four little-known American <a href=#>slave revolts</a> that helped bring about the Civil War.
