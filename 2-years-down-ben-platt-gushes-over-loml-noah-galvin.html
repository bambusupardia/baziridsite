After years of friendship, <a href=#><strong>Ben Platt</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Noah Galvin</strong></a>’s relationship turned romantic as they spent time together in lockdown amid <a href=#>the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Ben and I are dating,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Good Doctor</a>&nbsp;</i>actor first revealed <a href=#>during a May 2020 appearance on <strong>Ilana Levine</strong>’s “Little Known Things” podcast</a>. “I asked him this morning. I was like, ‘Are we allowed to talk about this?’ And he’s like, ‘Don’t go into our nitty-gritty, but yeah, people can know.’ It’s still relatively new.”</p><p class=p1>The duo — who have <a href=#>both portrayed the titular character in Broadway’s Dear Evan Hansen</a> — kept their romance relative private after confirming the news. However, they often <a href=#>can’t resist gushing about one another</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Long story short, Ben made me a birthday video. Ben very sweetly for the past, like, probably three months, has been putting together this video for me,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Real O’Neals&nbsp;</i>alum</a> said during the podcast interview. “It’s all my favorite drag queens from&nbsp;<a href=#><i>RuPaul’s Drag Race</i></a>&nbsp;and beyond and all of my friends in drag, wishing me a&nbsp;happy birthday.”</p><p class=p1>Shortly after <a href=#>the musical theatre stars quarantined together</a> — and costarred in a series of “QuaranTunes Dance Parties” on Instagram — the pair grew even closer while staying at Platt’s childhood home, eventually <a href=#>getting a labradoodle named George together</a>. The budding romance has provided major creative inspiration for both of the actors.</p><p class=p1>“The song [‘Imagine’] came to me from <strong>Michael Pollack</strong>, who’s a really brilliant songwriter [and is] my EP on my whole second album … It spoke to me immediately because I recently entered into a relationship this year with my boyfriend, Noah Galvin,” the&nbsp;<i>Politician&nbsp;</i>star explained during a June 2021 interview on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The&nbsp;Kelly Clarkson Show</i></a>. “We’ve been together for about a year and a half now. It was really crazy, we’ve been friends for, like, five years and right before the pandemic, we finally decided to, like, really give it a shot.”</p><p class=p1>He told host <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>, “We’ve <a href=#>kind of skated around it for a long time</a> and then it was, like, zero to 60, like we’re living together with my parents in [my] childhood home and seeing each other all the time. But it ended up being a beautiful time.”</p><p class=p1>Since then, their relationship has continued to flourish as they’ve each shared sweet tributes via social media.</p><p class=p1>“2021 often deeply sucked and yet he somehow made it mostly wonderful,” the California native wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> in December 2021 alongside a cozy selfie of the pair.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to relive Platt and Galvin’s romance milestones:</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toal2usqK%2B0mabqK%2BeYq%2Bmuoypo5qspGK0tr%2FHnqpmp6aav264zqajZqaflrVus8ClraKmXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
