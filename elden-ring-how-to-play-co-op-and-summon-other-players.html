If that’s the case, you can set up multiplayer and group passwords. Simply navigate to the Multiplayer tab in the Main Menu, create a unique password, and share it with your friends. When they type the password into their game, they can join you and vice versa. While this system prevents random strangers from filling up limited ally slots, it doesn’t prevent them from invading your session.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you have an active subscription but just don’t want to participate in multiplayer, you can disable co-op by visiting the Main Menu, selecting the “System” tab, then picking “Network” and finally setting the game to “Play Offline.”</p><h2>How to Summon Other Players</h2><p>While potentially any player can help you any time in <strong>Elden Ring</strong>, the game’s co-op system isn’t purely drop-in, drop-out multiplayer. As with other Soulsbornes, you need specific items to initiate the team up.</p><p>Multiplayer in <strong>Elden Ring</strong> hinges on items known as Fingers. In order to actually start, players need a Furlcalling Finger Remedy (which can be crafted with Erdleaf Flowers) to reveal Summon Signs. Simply interact with a sign to summon another player into your world, but pay close attention to its color. If the sign is gold, you are inviting a friendly ally, but if it is red, you are challenging another player to a duel.</p><p>If you want help in a dungeon or when setting out from a Site of Grace, you don’t need to seek out Summon Signs. Instead, you can find Summoning Pools at the beginning of optional dungeons, dotted throughout Legacy Dungeons, and near <strong>Elden Ring</strong>’s bonfire analogues. If allies are available, a Martyr Effigy (a stone carved to look like a human using the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Praise the Sun</a> emote) will spawn in the pool. Like Summon Signs, you have to interact with a Martyr Effigy, but this time, you need to scroll through a list of gamers before you can summon one. Once again, Martyr Effigies come in two colors: gold for co-op multiplayer, red for competitive.</p><h2>Creating Summon Signs and Martyr Effigies</h2><p>If you don’t want to ask another player for assistance but would rather be the summoned help, you don’t need to check nearby Summon Signs or Martyr Effigies. Instead, you create your own, and players can interact with them and call you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOnqOdnZ5iv6q6xmafqK9dqbxuvMuasGabn2K8sXnAp5tmq6WiurC6jKiroZ2iYr2trdieqaxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
