D. Jakes reminded the congregation of his church that the black family is in danger of extinction because modern-day women place less importance on their femininity.</p><p>Black men are told to give up their masculinity and take on a more feminine identity, which is celebrated and rewarded.</p><h2 id=bishop-td-jakes-net-worth>Bishop TD Jakes Net Worth</h2><p>Bishop T.

Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith in Charleston, West Virginia, was fortunate enough to have Jakes on staff as an associate pastor.</p><p>Jakes and Serita first crossed paths not long after Serita’s baptism. As a new convert, he guided her in the right direction and helped her find her spiritual footing. During that period, the couple not only became romantically connected but also formed a close personal bond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZtmopGgsrR5wqikpp2eqXqirs6uq2avn6Kyr3nAp5tmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prLFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
