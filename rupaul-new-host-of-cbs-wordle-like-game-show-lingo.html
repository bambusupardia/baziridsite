Each answer is allocated to a spot with a giant ball positioned behind it. If the answer is chosen correctly, the ball will roll down and stop just before hitting the player. However, if the answer is wrong, the ball will fall and whack the player into the pool below. The questions get harder the more players each team loses. The longer they last, the more money they bank until one “dry” family member plays the final round for the $100,000 grand prize.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Playful, quick-witted and high-energy, Jay’s going to make a huge splash as our host of ‘The Quiz with Balls,’” Allison Wallach, Fox Entertainment’s president of unscripted programming, said in a statement. “No matter the stage or show, Jay’s singular brand of humor and comedic timing elevates everything he does. With him at the helm of ‘The Quiz with Balls,’ viewers of all ages are assured an exciting and hilarious hour of fun playing along with Jay and our family contestants.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Executive produced by Talpa Studios and Eureka Productions, the new series is set to premiere this summer of Fox. “The Quiz with Balls” premiered on SBS6 in The Netherlands, where it became an instant summer hit, receiving an order for a four-episode winter special. A second season of the show will air on SBS6 later this year. Talpa Studios will soon announce other markets where the format will travel to, following the U.S. launch.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Showrunner Anthony Carbone, John de Mol, Maarten Meijs, Chris Culvenor, Paul Franklin, Wes Dening and John Leahy executive produce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoqq9osHLZqWer12dvLTAjKidZpuSqHq4u9Gdo55lnJ64pnnGmqSeZaOdvLh5y6KloKdf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
